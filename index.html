        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p>
            I am a self-motivated, analytical, fast learner with strong leadership skills and a unique combination of
            knowledge, skills and abilities in the field of Informational Technology. After getting into data analytics
            out of college with KPMG, I really began to enjoy the technical and logical nature of programming with data.
            In order to dive deeper into the field, in 2020 I took on a Data Engineering consultant role with RSM where
            having good understanding of different technologies and it's intricacies became a lot more critical.
            Developing the skillset that can enable me to deliver a solution for any client's problem is what drives me
            to continue learning and diving deeper into the world of programming, one language at a time.

          <h3>Engineering Solutions</h3>
          <p>
             After joining RSM and becoming a consultant, I quickly understood that having a wide skillset with
             different technologies made you a problem-agnostic swiss-army knife able to cut through any data issue
             faced, and I wanted to be <strong>sharp</strong>. Working at RSM for over two years has given me the time
             and opportunity to learn a vast amount of different technologies both big and small, which allow me to
             confidently engineer and provide solutions to remedy problems faced by myself, my clients, and the world.

          <h3>Adaptability</h3>
          <p>
             Being able to operate and perform consistently in any situation is imperative to success, and as a
             consultant this stands especially true. While working with clients, unexpected obstacles such
             as outages, access issues, connection issues, or technological issues in general happen all the time.
             More importantly, working with different clients means working with a plethora of different teams and of
             course people. Calmly and effectively leading a team, no matter who, over unexpected obstacles is a skill
             that RSM has allowed me to develop and improve on day after day.
